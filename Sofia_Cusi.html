        <h4 class="text-box">Hi, I am Sofia Marie Tabura Cusi, a grade 10 student from St. Martin of Notre Dame of Tacurong College. I am a pre-mature baby, 7 and a half months old, I came out in my mom's womb and was born at Sandig Medical Clinic and Hospital at 10 o'clock in the evening and just turned 16 last September 12, 2023. I lived at 33 - A Quezon Avenue, Barangay Poblacion, Tacurong City, Sultan Kudarat, Philippines. I am an extroverted person, but it all depends on how comfortable I am around the people I am with. I enjoy assisting people in need, and if my abilities allow, I will assist them and provide them with what they require. It makes my heart happy to see their smiles and hear them thank me for doing so. My motto in life is "Live each day as if it were your last".</h4>

        <h4 class="text-box">My family is one of the most important and valuable gifts I have received in my life. I'm very grateful to have them in my life, so let me introduce my family, starting with my parents, Gay Marie T. Cusi and Vicente B. Cusi, who brought and introduced me to the world, who did their very best to provide us with our wants and needs, who protected and kept us safe from harms, who sacrificed everything for us, who cared and loved us unconditionally. I have a younger brother named Stephen Angelo T. Cusi, who is currently in 5th grade and goes to Tacurong Pilot Elementary School. He is the one who assists me with household chores, has helped me to become a caring person in the sense that I am the one who takes care of him when our parents are not present, and he also enlightens us at home. My family is my inspiration and motivation to do well in school, to give my all, and to pursue my dreams. Without them, I am nothing; I want to make them proud.</h4>

I have many friends, but my closest and bestest are Queisha, Darlene, Deanna, and Jean. They're basically my other half and the people I truly trust; I'm grateful that I met them and that they've become a part of my life. Close friends are truly life's treasures.</h4>

        <h4 class="text-box">Dancing gives me a great sense of enjoyment because it feels so fulfilling and fun. I dance in a variety of styles, including hiphop, folk dance, and festival dances. Dancing is my favourite hobby because it has provided me with numerous opportunities, such as competing in kadayawan in Davao in their festival dance, grand slam during kiay kiay sa talakudong representing tribu manubiaw, and other school and district dance competitions. When I'm bored or have nothing to do, I look up choreography online and learn to dance. Sometimes I just listen to music and my body moves along with the rhythm and beat of the music. My sport was badminton, which I had to give up because I didn't have enough time for trainings at the time, but I still play with my friends and classmates and consider it one of my hobbies.</h4>

        <h4 class="text-box">I've been at Notre Dame of Tacurong College for three years, since seventh grade, but the pandemic occurred during that time, and we only had online classes. Last year was the first time I stepped into NDTC to attend face-to-face classes; at first, it was difficult to adjust because my body had grown accustomed to staying at home, laying in bed, and sleeping late. Now that I'm in 10th grade, I'm finally adjusted and ready to learn new things, broaden my knowledge, get to know and interact with new people, especially my fellow students, and have fun and enjoy upcoming school programmes and events. This school year, I hope to be able to create more memorable and fun experiences, be less stressed, achieve my goals or have high grades, and, most importantly, overcome difficulties in school.</h4>
