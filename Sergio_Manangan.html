<pre><h4 align="center"><font color= white><p class="one"> Being born into this world is a blessed gift from God but first of all let me introduce myself, Hi my name is 
Sergio P. Manangan III and I'm 15 years old. I live at Virginia Integrated farm kalandagan, Tacurong City Sultan Kudarat. 
I was born on the 4th of August 2008. I love using my abilities to help others within my capable hands because it 
gives me satisfaction that my work may be of help to others.I don't want to be 
restricted in life I wanna be free like the birds and live my life to the fullest.</p>

<p>My family is the greatest gift that God has bestowed upon me and they are the ray of joy that enlightens me. Let me introduce my family first of all my father
his name is Sergio P. Manangan Jr. He is the one that enlightens the house when it is gloomy he is my pride and joy and as a father he made a lot of sacrifices
up to this day if it weren't for him I wouldn't be a good student because of his discipline. He is my idol in life and being a great father to a family of five. 
My mother's name is Alona P. Manangan she is a strong independent, outstanding, kind hearted and hard working woman who strives for success in life. She is my 
inspiration in life being a successful doctor and keep on studying expanding her knowledge and wisdom. She keeps on working even to the point of exhaustion and 
sometimes not even sleeping and I am blessed to have them as my parents. lastly I have two siblings whose are Juliana Alona P. Manangan and Sergio P. Manangan IV. 
We each have our differences but in the end we are your typical loving siblings. </p>

<p>My school serves as more than simply a classroom. It offers lots of chances to socialize. At Notre Dame of Tacurong College, I attend classes. I'm a tenth grader.
I won't lie and say that I hate going to school. I constantly stress about forthcoming tests, exams, and other things.I constantly feel exhausted, sleepy, and 
depleted of energy when I go home, yet I have to study. But I always believe that life is not truly worth living if there are no challenges.</p>
<br>
<p>My friends are the ones who have laughed with me, dried my tears, and have always been there for me. I have a lot of buddies on and off school premises. 
They provide truly amazing memories and remarkable experiences. They have never given me cause to be angry with them, and I always welcome them. They are also a 
part of my family my second brother's and sister's. I can always rely on them when I'm in need.</p>

<p>My hobbies are the pursuits I turn to for solace, motivation, and a sense of fulfilment. For me, exercising goes beyond simple physical exercise. It forces 
me to grow in both my physical and mental strength. Cycling and shooting is my sport, and whenever I hear the word cycling or shooting, I get really competitive.
I may not be the best but I always strive for improvement. I love doing long distance rides and down hilling but the sport I love the most is shooting. I am 
currently the junior division champion of Marbel, Gensan, and Kidapawan. My dream is to be on the Philippine national team and become a world class shooter.
I would like to thankful to my parents for supporting me in my hobbies and take me places just to compete.</p>
